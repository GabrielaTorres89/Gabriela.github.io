            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I’m a Senior Supply Chain Specialist with a strong background in optimizing supply chain processes and improving operational efficiency. I hold a BSBA in Marketing with a concentration in Supply Chain from East Carolina University, where I developed a solid foundation in both business and supply chain management.
Throughout my career, I've successfully led various projects, including the development of an Inventory Management System and a Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard. These projects have equipped me with practical skills in data analysis, process improvement, and risk assessment, all of which have contributed to my expertise in supply chain management.
Currently, I’m pursuing a new passion for programming and am in school to become a programmer. My goal is to combine my supply chain experience with my growing programming skills to create innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and address complex challenges in the supply chain sector.
Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities to collaborate.<p>
